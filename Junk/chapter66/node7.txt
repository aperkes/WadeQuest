You're on the steep edge of a cliff. There's a mongoose.
### Commands
look:the view is lovely. The mongoose is walking slowly towards you.
fly:You throw yourself majestically into the air, sadly you still can't fly. The mongoose looks on, but does nothing.
die:Why would you do that? well now you're dead
fight: always fighting things. The mongoose pushes you off the cliff. Too bad you didn't have a snake.
befriend the mongoose: the mongoose is a coy beast. She is not interested in friendship.
climb: you climb to safety. You're at the top of a beautiful mountain. Huzzah!
SAVE:and we're back
