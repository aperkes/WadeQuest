look:It's pretty hard to see, what with all the water in your eyes
goggles: nice, you can see there's a waterfall, but it's still pretty far off. It seems like there might be a cave underwater.
get out: no can do, the streams actually moving pretty fast. Come to think of it, this seems sort of dangerous...
fly:Psh, like you can do that. Try again in a few chapters
walk: too deep for that, sorry bro
deeper: that seems a little counterintuitive. Luckily you find yourself in a cave
cave: well ok.
underwater: interesting plan. Oh hey, there's a cave! I didn't see that coming.
die:Why would you do that? well now you're dead
drown: yep, you drown. that was easy.
SAVE:and we're back
