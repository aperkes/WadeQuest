The corridor is wide here.\nOn the floor below you there's a mosaic of a great beast. It's eyes are shining, and seem to follow you as you move.\nThe corridors head West, South, and East.

east: You head East
west: You head West
eyes: The eyes are set in stone, there doesn't seem to be anything you can do with it. 
book: You can't pull the book out of the shelf. The spines are written in a language you've never seen.

shelf: The shelf is blocking your way, you're just going to have to accept that.
