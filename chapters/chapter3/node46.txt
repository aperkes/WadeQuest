Boss Fight: this better be good. \nAs you walk in, a big gust of wind blows your torch out of your hand. It falls cold against the wall.\n As your eyes adjust you see two torches across from you. From their faint light you can see that you are in a huge cavern.\n ... \n You hear a deep rumbling. It could be breathing but it sounds like rumbling thunder.\n   \n Suddenly, the torches rise up above you, and you realize that they aren't torches, but the eyes of a great beast.\nThe light from his eyes grows with anger, and you can see his grotesque body.\nHis face is like a man, with yellow teeth and a tangled beard. His body is like a bull, though thick clouds cover him,\nmaking it difficult to see his form. \n\nBlack smoke drifts slowly from his mouth as a tail flows smoothly through the mist.\nHis eyes burn brightly as they gaze upon you with anger...and hunger.

*%*:Before you can act, he rushes at you, pinning you to the ground.\nHis laugh shakes the cavern all around you.\n"You thought you could face me with no weapon? You are more foolish than the last." The last thing you see are his yellow teeth, as smoke engulfs you.
