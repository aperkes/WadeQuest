When you open the door, instead of your house, you see a huge library.\nThe book shelves form corridors. It feels like a labyrinth.\nBefore you know it, the door shuts behind you.\n\n...\nAs you wonder what to do, you feel a weight in your pocket.\n"What have I got in my pocket?" you wonder aloud.\nYou reach into your pocket to reveal a shiny compass.\nYou check it and see that corridor is heading south.
