Man, you totally beat up that old man. How do you feel about that? \n Anyway, The woods seem to be getting a little thinner, and there are some big boulders. It seems like you're headed up a mountain.
### Commands

fly:Psh, like you can do that. Try again in a few chapters
SAVE:and we're back
pick up the snake: You probably though this was going to end poorly, but it turns out the snake is very friendly. Now you have a new friend.
bite the snake: I should have known. The snake is tasty
walk: playing it safe eh? the snake doesn't bother you, and you keep going.
