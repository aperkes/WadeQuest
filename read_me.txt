To play the game, open the terminal. 
You must first set the current directory (this should change eventually, but for now this is how we're doing it...)
The easiest way to do this is to type 'cd' and then drag the game file (Ethan) into the terminal window
so your command line should look almost exactly like this: 

cd /Users/ammonperkes/Documents/WadeQuest/Ethan 

once you've done this type './myroom.py' (python myroom.py also works) 

Commands:
Commands are up to you, and can change based on the setting, but there are some that will usually work: 
explore: This will look around and see what there is to work with. 
help: This will usually give you a hint as to what do to
walk: If you can walk to get somewhere, this will often work. Sometimes there are obstacles though. 
get: If there's something to be got, this will get it. 
QUIT: This will let you quit wherever you are
SAVE: This will let you save, but you can only save in certain places. It will tell you when you can save. 
open: This open's stuff
